# Nepal Cyber Resilience

## Overview
Nepal Cyber Resilience is a web-based initiative designed to educate, inform, and protect Nepali internet users from cyber threats. This platform offers cybersecurity awareness in both English and Nepali, enabling users to learn about hacking, phishing, malware, and general safety practices. The aim is to provide a resilient digital shield by educating users and giving them tools to defend against common attacks. The project consists of a React + Vite frontend and a Node.js/Express backend with Sequelize ORM and Google OAuth integration.

## Features
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Files are encrypted before storage; only users can decrypt their data.
- **Google OAuth & Email Authentication:** Secure login with Google or email/password.
- **File Upload & Management:** Upload, download, preview, and delete files (up to 50MB each).
- **User Dashboard:** Manage files, view storage usage, and update profile.
- **Profile Management:** Update user info and profile picture.
- **Password Reset:** Secure password reset via email.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects against brute-force and abuse.
- **Responsive UI:** Modern, mobile-friendly interface with Bootstrap and custom styles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite (for production; SQLite works for dev)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DropSafe.git
cd DropSafe
```

### 2. Setup the Backend
```bash
cd my-backend
npm install
# Copy and edit environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your DB, JWT, and ENCRYPTION_KEY
# Run migrations (if using Sequelize CLI)
# npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npm start
```

#### Backend Environment Variables (`my-backend/.env`)
- `PORT=5000`
- `DATABASE_URL=...` (or DB config variables)
- `JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret`
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_64_char_hex_key` (use `openssl rand -hex 32`)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...`
- `EMAIL_USER=...` (for password reset)
- `EMAIL_PASS=...`

### 3. Setup the Frontend
```bash
cd ../dropsafe-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend Environment Variables (`dropsafe-frontend/.env`)
- `VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000`
- `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...`

---

## Usage
- Visit `http://localhost:5173` (or as shown in terminal)
- Register or login (Google or email)
- Upload, preview, download, and delete files from the dashboard
- Update your profile and password

## API Overview (Backend)
- `POST   /api/auth/register` — Register new user
- `POST   /api/auth/login` — Login with email/password
- `POST   /api/auth/google-auth` — Login with Google
- `POST   /api/auth/request-password-reset` — Request password reset
- `POST   /api/auth/reset-password` — Reset password
- `GET    /api/files` — List user files
- `POST   /api/files/upload` — Upload file (multipart/form-data)
- `GET    /api/files/view/:id` — View/decrypt file (inline or download)
- `DELETE /api/files/:id` — Delete file
- `GET    /api/user/profile` — Get user profile
- `PUT    /api/user/profile` — Update profile
- `POST   /api/user/profile-picture` — Upload profile picture

> All file and user routes require authentication (JWT in `Authorization: Bearer ...` header).

## Security Notes
- **Encryption:** Files are encrypted with AES-256-CBC using a per-file IV and a server-side key. Only authenticated users can access their files.
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens for session management; Google OAuth supported.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents brute-force and abuse.
- **Input Validation:** All user input is validated and sanitized.

## Deployment
- Frontend can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or any static host.
- Backend can be deployed to any Node.js server (Heroku, Render, etc.).
- Set environment variables for production in both frontend and backend.
